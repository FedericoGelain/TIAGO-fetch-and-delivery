# TIAGO-fetch-and-delivery
This project was developed for the Intelligent Robotics course, held by professor Emanuele Menegatti, Universit√† degli Studi di Padova.
The goal was to develop a routine that allowed TIAGo to automatically pick and place objects that were positioned on top of a table.
After navigating through the laboratory environment, making use of the LiDAR placed at the base of the robot to detect walls and obstacles (main focus of the code found in the Assignment 1 folder), TIAGo reaches a table on top of which several objects of different shapes and colors are placed. Using the camera placed on its head, it was possible to detect the AprilTags placed on each object, storing an ID for recognition and the corresponding pose with respect to the robot reference frame. The desired object was then picked with a combination of RViz, to create the objects collisions, and the MoveIt library to plan and execute a safe and smooth tracjetory of the robot arm. Finally, the picked object was placed on top of the corresponding (color-wise) cylinder table.
